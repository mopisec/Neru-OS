      <div class="description-title">Feature of NeruOS</div>
      <div class="point-title">Original Window Design and Desktop Layout</div>
      <div class="point-description">
        This is the first feature that I worked on. HariboteOS has window design like "Windows 95", but I wanted to make my OS with full of originarity. So, I changed desktop design and desktop layout. It was really hard to design. I calculated height and width to make beautiful layout, so it was long fight with debugging.

      <div class="point-title">Serial Communication</div>
      <div class="point-description">
        After implementing original window design and desktop layout, I wanted to implement serial communication. Because when I was viewing <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">OSDev.org</a>, I founded article about serial communication. Then I thought I may implement it on my hobby operating system. Now, commands that output PCI Vendor ID through serial communication is available. Now only system and user console can output data so I am planning to implement application API for sending data through serial communication.

      <div class="point-title">PCI Bus Configuration</div>
      <div class="point-description">
        Next, I wanted to control devices that is available. But to do that, I needed to work on PCI Bus Configuration. For now, it can just output Vendor ID but I am now developing function to scan device and control it.
